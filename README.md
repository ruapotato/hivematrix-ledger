# HiveMatrix Ledger

Billing calculation and invoicing platform for MSP customer billing.

Ledger calculates customer bills based on:
- **Per-unit pricing** (per-user, per-server, per-workstation rates)
- **Billing plans** with different service tiers
- **Line items** for additional services
- **Asset counts** from Codex integration
- **Custom overrides** for special pricing

Not a blockchain - it's an accounting ledger for MSP billing!
